One

Another

ANOTHER

We
settle
on
the
CAR
from

this

is
playing
The

is
a
YOUNG

She
hums
along

starts
SINGING

EXITS

He's
playing

Then
a

We

Why

it's
a
dirty

LAURA
Unpaid

not

Call

She
heads
to
the
door
He
follows
her
won't
give
it
up
SEBASTIAN
You're
acting
like
life's
got
me
on
the
ropes
what
you
don't
understand
is
I
want
to
be
on
the
ropes
I'm
letting
life
hit
me
til
it
gets
tired
Then
I'm
gonna
make
my

It's
a
classic
rope
a
dope
Laura
can't
help
but
laugh
Stops
by

Looks

Unpack

She's

Sebastian
thinks
for
a

then
calls
out
SEBASTIAN
I'm

phoenix
rising
from

No

SEBASTIAN
Of

Though
I
don't

they
care

I

A
WAITRESS
passes

There's
a
nice

RESTAURANT
LATER
The
restaurant's
demographic
has
changed
It's
now
younger
stragglers
wandering

Sebastian
looks
beyond
bored
He
finishes
We
Wish
You
a
Merry
Christmas
Zero
applause
He
begins
a
new
chart
Deck
the
Halls
But
something
seems
to
come
over
him
now
He's
restless
Slowly
his
playing
drifts
off
his
fingers
charting
their
own
path
And
then
we
hear
a
melody
The
one
Mia
heard
outside
The
one
we'll
refer
to
from
now
on
as
Mia
and
Sebastian's
song
The
door
opens
and
Mia
steps
in
She
sees
Sebastian
at
the
piano
Is
instantly
struck
by
his
playing
MIA
AND
SEBASTIAN'S
THEME
Gradually
all
sounds
but
the
music
drop
out
We
drift
away
from
reality
Even
the
walls
seem
to
go
slightly
darker
as
though
Sebastian
and
Mia
were
all
alone
He
concludes
his
piece
with
a
jumble
of
chords
his
playing
almost
free
jazz
now
as
we
pull
back
to
real
life
and
see
the
Boss
looking
on
in
scorn
Revision
Sebastian
finishes
Silence
Mia
looks
like
the
wind
has
been
knocked
out
of
her
Sebastian
looks
up
for
a
second
and
sees
her
They
look
at
one
another
Just
a
moment
Then
the
Boss
taps
Sebastian
on
the
shoulder
WE
STAY
ON
Mia
as
she
watches
Sebastian
rise
with
the
Boss
We
just
see
the
Boss
talking
to
Sebastian
can't
hear
what
is
said
Then
we
get
closer
and
realize
BOSS
every
goddamned
night
Sebastian
is
silent
Then
doesn't
want
to
have
to
beg
but
SEBASTIAN
I'll
stick
to
the
set
list
I
promise
BOSS
Too
late
You're
done
SEBASTIAN
You're
not
gonna
find
a
better
player
You
know
that
BOSS
leans
in
and
Do
you
think
anyone
here
gives
a
shit
With
that
the
Boss
walks
off
We
linger
on
Sebastian
Anger
giving
way
to
hurt
He
starts
hurrying
toward
the
door
BACK
TO
Mia
who
didn't
hear
what
was
said
She
watches
Sebastian
takes
a
breath
so
moved
that
she's
about
to
lay
it
all
out
swoops
in
to
corner
him
and
MIA
I
just
wanted
to
say
I
saw
your
playing
and
I
but
Sebastian
just
walks
right
by
his
shoulder
bumping
against
Mia's
for
an
added
measure
of
disdain
He
heads
out
the
door
Slams
it
shut
Mia
is
left
standing
on
her
own
She
looks

she's

Probably
gives

you
find
your
car
more
quickly

You
don't
live
as
long
but
you
get

done
faster
so
it
all
evens
out

Oh

then
they
reach
a

THE
CITY
SKYLINE
APPEARS
BELOW
A

stretching
as
far
as
you
can
see
It's

most
romantic
sight

look
at

And
then

Eh
They
walk
on
the

shimmering
behind
SEBASTIAN
Not
much
to
look
at
MIA
Agreed
I've
seen
better
And
on
that
they
SING
A
LOVELY
NIGHT
Mia
and
Sebastian
try
to
downplay
the
romanticism
of
this
setting
this
moment
being
lost
here
at
night
alone
together
atop
a
hill
the
city
glittering
before
them
It's
no
big
deal
nothing
they
haven't
seen
or
felt
before
because
after
all
there's
no
chance
for
romance
between
them
Of
course
the
music
swelling
and
building
suggests
otherwise
Mia
tires
of
her
heels
finds
a
bench
and
fishes
for
flats
in
her
handbag
Sebastian
sits
beside
her
as
she
slips
the
flats
on
They
look
at
each
other
suspicious
Revision
He
moves
his
foot
She
moves
hers
They
look
at
each
other
again
Still
suspicious
He
moves
again
She
moves
again
They
seem
to
be
moving
in
sync
without
their
even
wanting
to
And
bit
by
bit
before
our
eyes
they've
almost
slipped
into

Sebastian
rises
Mia
rises
as
well
The
two
look
at
each
other
Run
back
to
the
bench
hop
atop
it
the
lights
stretch
out
like
a
magic
carpet
They
share
a
moment
share
a
look
jump
off
AND
START
REALLY
DANCING
NOW
Mia
does
a
move
Sebastian
responds
Sebastian
does

Mia
shakes
her
head
Nope
They
make
the
road
their
own
growing
more
and
more
energized
as
surprised
as
we
are
to
find
that
they
can
really
dance
together
Just
as
this
starts
to
look
like
a
blossoming
romance
real
joy
peeking
through
our
two
heroes
getting
closer
and
closer
and
closer
looking
at
each
other
almost
giddily
a
sound
cuts
through
It's
a
CELL
PHONE
ring
Mia
and
Sebastian
turn
to
her
handbag
back

Snapped

SEBASTIAN
How'd
you
get
into
all
this
Revision
MIA
Into
Oh
I
my
aunt
was
an
actress
She
was
in
this
traveling
theater
company
And
there
was
this
little
library
across
the
street
from
my
house
when
I
was
growing
up
This
was
Boulder
City
Nevada
every
house
looked
exactly
the
same
I
was
ten
and
already
I
needed
to
get
out
And
one
day
my
aunt
flew
into
town
and
she
showed
me
the
library's
old
movie
section
We
spent
a
whole
day
watching
one
after
the
other
Bringing
Up
Baby
Notorious
Casablanca
a
beat
then
I
never
knew
the
world
was
so
big
DIRECTOR
O
S
Cut
Mia
and
Sebastian
resume
walking
Now
at
full
volume
MIA
I
started
putting
on
plays
in
my
garage
I'd
write
the
scripts
and
print
up
programs
and
she'd
give
me
props
to
use
from
wherever
she'd
just
been
New
York
London
Paris
And
then
she'd
jet
off
again
and
I
wouldn't
hear
from
her
for
another
year
SEBASTIAN
Who
would
you
invite
to
watch
Your
parents
MIA
God
no
I
didn't
invite
anyone
That
would
have
been
terrifying
CUT
TO
The
entrance
to
a
giant
soundstage
MIA
CONT'D
Honestly
I
wish
I
loved
something
else
I've
tried
so
hard
to
want
other
things
She
and
Sebastian
stop
Peer
inside
the
stage
MIA
CONT'D
I
left
school
after
two
years
to
come
here
my
fourth
manager
just
dropped
me
and
my
last
audition
was
for
a
teen
soap
pitched
as
Dangerous
Minds
meets
The

C

deadpan
Should've
been
a
lawyer
Revision
They
resume
walking
CUT
TO
A
row
of
closed
soundstages
sandy
tan
against
the
bright
blue
sky
SEBASTIAN
Cause
the
world
needs
more
lawyers
MIA
Well
it
doesn't
need
more
actresses
SEBASTIAN
You're
not
just
an
actress
MIA
What
do
you
mean
just
an
actress
SEBASTIAN
You
said
it
yourself
you're
a
child
prodigy
playwright
MIA
That
is
not
what
I
said
SEBASTIAN
You're
too
modest
to
say
it
but
it's
true
So
you
could
write
your
own
roles
Write
something
that's
as
interesting
as
you
are
MIA
Last
thing
I
wrote
was
a
stand
up
routine
for
an
open
mic
night
It
was
horrible
SEBASTIAN
All
I'm
saying
is
Louis
Armstrong
could
have
played
the
marching
band
charts
he
was
given
What
did
he
do
instead
He
made
history
MIA
Ok
I'll
stop
auditioning
and
make
history
instead
Sebastian
laughs
MIA
CONT'D
Anyway
I'm
getting
a
feeling
there's
something
I
should
tell
you
SEBASTIAN
Yeah
Revision
MIA
I
hate
jazz
Sebastian
stops
Turns
to
her
SEBASTIAN
What
does
that
mean
I
hate
jazz
MIA
It
means
when
I
listen
to
it
I
don't
like
it
SEBASTIAN
But
it's
such
a
blanket
statement
It's
like
saying
I
hate
animals
MIA
I
do
hate
some
animals
SEBASTIAN
Do
you
need
to
be
anywhere
right
now
Mia
looks
at
him
We
hear
DRUMS
A
swinging
ride
pattern
And
we're
in

JAZZ
CLUB
It's
almost
empty
only
aged
JAZZ
CATS
here
except
for
Mia
and
Sebastian
watching
a
QUARTET
SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
Most
people
say
they
hate
jazz
because
they
don't
have
context
They
don't
get
where
it
came
from
All
these
people
packed
into
flophouses
in
New
Orleans
speaking
five
different
languages
and
jazz
was
how
they
talked
to
each
other
MIA
I
thought
it
was
just
Kenny
G
SEBASTIAN
What
Mia
looks
at
him
Already
knows
just
how
to
get
to
him
MIA
I
associate
it
with
facials
It's
relaxing
SEBASTIAN
It's
not
relaxing
Sid
Bechet
got
into
a
gunfight
cause
somebody
told
him
he
played
a
wrong
note
Revision
MIA
laying
it
on
thick
Right
but
it's
good
to
talk
over
Where
I
grew
up
there's
this
jazz
station
they'd
play
at
cocktail
parties
whenever
they
served
the
salami
and
cheese
SEBASTIAN
Mia
These
are
things
you
can't
unsay
She
bursts
into
laughter
Sebastian
points
to
the
band
SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
It's
not
cocktail
music
it's
a
high
wire
act
These
guys
are
performing
and
composing
and
rearranging
all
at
once
A
beat
Mia
looks
at
the
band
We
DRIFT
over
the
instruments
SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
That's
why
you
need
to
be
in
the
space
and
see
what's
at
stake
This
whole
thing
it's
dying
In
twenty
minutes
they'll
head
off
to
cut
commercial
sessions
or
do
pit
at
the
Pantages
cause
they
have
to
but
when
I
have
my
own
place
my
club
they'll
play
whatever
they
want
Mia
looks
at
Sebastian
Her
laughter
has
subsided
She
can
see
something
in
him
now
the
same
passion
he's
speaking
of
MIA
Your
club
SEBASTIAN
It's
gonna
be
the
old
Van
Beek
I'm
getting
the
lease
back
It'll
be
perfect
He
watches
the
band
Lost
in
the
sound
Then
sincere
SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
The
world
tells
everyone
to
move
on
Says
the
music's
had
its
moment
But
I
love
it
too
much
I'm
not
moving
on
The
band
finishes
The
ride
cymbal
sizzles
in
the
air
SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
So
He
looks
at
Mia
She's
visibly
moved
Just

He
rounds

and
begins
to
SING
CITY
OF

Lifted
by
a
strange
new
feeling
a
feeling
he
wasn't
expecting
The
feeling
that
perhaps
just
perhaps
he's
falling
in
love
He
gazes
out
at
the
sea
the
purple
sky
Dances
with
an
OLD
COUPLE
then
continues
on
his
way
as
though
caught
in
a
dream
There's
an
uncertainty
in
his
singing
he's
not
sure
if
this
dream
will
sustain

for

it's

look
at
one
another
Circle
the
pendulum
and
then
so
tenderly
so
nervously
Revision
they
begin
to
DANCE
This
is
a
dance
that
fulfills
all
the
promise
in
their
earlier
duet
They
circle
the
floor
gently
and
gracefully
The
music
BUILDS
and
they
drift
into
the
PLANETARIUM
It's
darkened
empty
Mia
removes
her
shoes
feels
the
soft
carpet
under
her
feet
Turns
on
the
projector
The
screen
STARTS
TO
GLOW
She
and
Sebastian
take
in
the
sight
the
STARS
and
GALAXIES
Enchanted
they
look
at
one
another
the
lights
from
the
screen
reflected
on
their
faces
They
approach
as
though
about
to
kiss
When
Mia's
shoes
LIFT
UP
Float
toward
the
ceiling
toward
the
star
filled
screen
She
and
Sebastian
trade
looks
Realize
And
then
they
too
begin
to
FLOAT
RISING
from
the
floor
nothing
stopping
them
SOARING
past
the
views
of
comets
and
moons
and
nebulae
Eyes
wide
their
emotions
seized
as
they
HOLD
EACH
OTHER
TIGHT
And
so
unspools
a
gravity
free
dance
Mia
and
Sebastian
SPIN
and
TWIRL
through
the
planetarium
as
though
they
themselves
were
in
outer
space
flying
through
the
cosmos
The
music
carries
them
higher
and
higher
and
their
spirits
likewise
soar
JOYOUS
EXUBERANT
until
finally
the
music
SOFTENS
Mia
and
Sebastian
drift
back
to
the
floor
like
feathers
They
land
on
a
pair
of
seats
There
once
again
seated
like
audience
members
at
a
movie
they
turn
and
look
into
each
other's
eyes
The
music
picks
back
up
for
the
big
finish
as
the
lovers
lean
in
and
in
true
movie
movie
old
Hollywood
big
musical

LOCK
LIPS
It's
their
first
kiss
and
it's
a
kiss
to
remember
full
of
all
the
hope
and
yearning
and
terror
and
wonder
of
love's
first
blush
A
swoon
worthy
kiss
with
the
orchestra
soaring
and
the
camera
swooping
in
to
catch
the
embrace
in
all
its
glory
